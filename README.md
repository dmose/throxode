*Throxode* is a simple throttling HTTP proxy for node.js. At present,
it's a bit akin to [throxy.py][], only in JavaScript instead of Python.

There are currently a few quirks with it, and I'm not sure if they're
my doing or latent bugs in node. I suspect they're the former, but the
stack traces often don't have my code anywhere in them.
